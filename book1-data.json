It required an almost irrational **faith** to continue, especially when his funding applications would invariably fail to **receive** a positive response.

The Sonata was composed for a long-extinct **instrument**, a hybrid string-percussion device. Alistair realized that to unlock the composition's true artistic **potential (n.)**, he first had to physically reconstruct this forgotten apparatus, anticipating every **potential (adj.)** acoustic challenge and material limitation. The project's success was contingent upon this reconstruction. The insights he gleaned from an obscure treatise on ancient metallurgy proved **invaluable**, allowing him to finally fabricate the device.

The composition was not designed to soothe, but to completely **dazzle** the listener, deconstructing their preconceptions of harmony. The performance was a resounding success.
