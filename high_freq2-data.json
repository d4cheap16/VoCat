He soon found himself completely **alienated** from the inner circle, his memos unanswered.\n\nIn response, Vance initiated what could only be described as an internal **campaign** for reform. He bypassed the leadership and presented his findings directly to the junior members. The result was predictable: utter **chaos**. The organization, once a place of quiet consensus, became a battlefield of academic warfare.\n\nThe established members tried to **confine** the damage, limiting his access to archives and restricting his speaking time at symposia. The situation became so **chaotic** that the chairwoman had to intervene. She tried to **assure** the members that proper procedure would be followed, but the trust within the institution was already broken."}
